I"¹<p>Pathologies such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis reduce diarthrodial joint function and quality of life. Although proteins and small molecule drugs can alleviate symptoms and disease progression, their systemic administration poses serious side effects and may not reach the target site. This motivates our work to prolong drug residence time and bioactivity in health and disease. We are currently studying drug transport through the synovium, a multi-layered connective tissue whose capillaries and lymphatic vessels clear both small and large molecules from the joint space. We coupled experimental data with computational models to show that solute size affects diffusivity in synovial explants. This approach can predict factors that regulate intra-articular drug transport. The Setton Lab has also developed injectable drug carriers for intra-articular delivery that increase particle size and residence time in the joint space.</p>
