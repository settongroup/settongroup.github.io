I"ñ<p>The Setton lab has studied cell-matrix interactions that regulate cellular synthesis and phenotype in intervertebral disc (IVD) pathology. Our work has shown that environmental cues, such as physical stiffness and attachment ligands, regulate healthy disc cell phenotype. We apply this knowledge to design biomaterials that mimic key environmental cues for primary disc cells and progenitor cells. Injectable biomaterial carriers are used to deliver cells that restore the degenerated IVD.</p>
