I"	<p>Intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration greatly contributes to low back pain; how the IVD generates this pain remains unclear. The Setton Lab images sensory neuron activation in pre-clinical models of IVD degeneration by recording Ca2+-sensitive fluorescence indicators. In collaboration with the Tang Lab, this work studies temporal and spatial changes in behavior and sensitivity, neuronal function and innervation patterns, hemodynamics of brain activity, and how their crosstalk changes in the degenerated IVD.</p>
